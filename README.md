# jAsmInt
Something I did some time ago as experiment -> a interpreter for a custom bytecode for the arduino.

It interpretes the bytecode created by https://github.com/aligator/jASMc

The interpreter is unfinished as I remember.

[The Problem is that I have a docu about the bytecode only in german and as .odt file (why^^)](https://github.com/aligator/jASM/blob/master/jASM-Bytecode-Interpreter/doc/jASM-description.odt)
