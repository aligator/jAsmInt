# jAsmInt
Something I did some time ago as experiment -> a interpreter for a custom bytecode for the arduino.

It interpretes the bytecode created by https://github.com/aligator/jASMc

The interpreter is unfinished as I remember.

The Problem is that I have no exact documentation anymore about how the bytecode looks like...
